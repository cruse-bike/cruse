To play, enter a five-letter English word. For example:</p> <div class="example svelte-1x5nq1n"><span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">r</span> <span class="missing svelte-1x5nq1n">i</span> <span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">t</span> <span class="missing svelte-1x5nq1n">z</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">y</span></div> <p class="svelte-1x5nq1n">The <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">y</span> is in the right place. <span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">r</span> and <span class="close svelte-1x5nq1n">t</span> are the right letters, but in the wrong place. The other letters are wrong, and can be discarded. Let's make another guess:</p> <div class="example svelte-1x5nq1n"><span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">p</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">a</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">r</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">t</span> <span class="exact svelte-1x5nq1n">y</span></div> <p>This time we guessed right! You have <strong>six</strong> guesses to get the word.</p> <p>Unlike the original Wordle, Sverdle runs on the server instead of in the browser, making it impossible to cheat. It uses <code>&lt;form></code> and cookies to submit data, meaning you can even play with JavaScript disabled!</p></div>`;
